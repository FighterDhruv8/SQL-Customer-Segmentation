This is a personal project to practice SQL.

The 'Data.sql' file contains the MySQL schema and data required.

'Sales Trends.py' is a file that provides different metrics to analyze sales using various MySQL queries.

'Customer Segmentation.py' and 'Customer Segmentation.ipynb' is the same code, in python script and jupyter notebook versions. It performs customer segmentation using RFM analysis and k-means clustering on the dataset. To determine optimal number of clusters for the k-means algorithm, 4 different methods are used: Elbow method, Silhouette Score, Gap Statistic, and Calinski-Harabasz Index. The user can choose how many clusters to use based on the number suggested by the 4 methods.
